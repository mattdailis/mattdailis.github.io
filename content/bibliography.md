Here, I hope to keep a running list of things I'm reading/watching, with short sentence summaries, explanations, or recommendations for each.

<details><summary>Purely Functional Data Structures (Chris Okasaki)</summary>
  I read through chapter 3. This dissertation shows
  that it is possible to perform "amortized" runtime analysis on purely functional data structures if
  your langauge supports laziness and memoization. I found the first few chapters easy to follow and
  thought he did a great job of explaining amortized analysis (I had never understood it before). I followed
  along in OCaml (turns out there's a `Lazy` module you can import!) I started to lose steam on the purely 
  functional "Bankers method".

<details><summary>"Compositional" Compiler Correctness (Amal Ahmed)</summary>
I've been a fan of Amal's work for a long time, and I've long wanted to dig into some of it, but was always intimidated. This presentation is a very accessible overview of the challenges of proving things about compilers when you don't know a priori what they will be linked with.

<details><summary>Types and Programming Languages (Benjamin Pierce)</summary>
 This book is a pre-requisite to those who want to study programming languages at Northeastern. I got it
 for myself as a graduation present, and have been flipping through chapters at random ever since.
