I don't expect to update this page regularly - but in my day-to-day endeavors to learn new things,
sometimes I feel like it would be beneficial to test these learnings and try to write about them.

My hope is that this blog will be these things for me:
- A place to track interesting things I've read/watched/listened to
- An outlet for my desire to teach people things, without needing to bother any real people
- A place to practice writing

If, in this blog for myself, you find something that you find interesting, or helps you learn something,
great!
